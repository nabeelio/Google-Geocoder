Introduction:
-------------

For a project I've been working on, I need to get some detailed data 
about some businesses. So using the Google Geocoder API was a no-brainer. So 
I just whipped up this quick class :)

Just takes your search string, and then asks the Geocoder API. Then parses
the returned JSON string for all the data.

Requirements:
------------

 * PHP 5+ w/ cURL and json_decode()
 * Google API Key (http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html)

Usage:
------------

	define('GOOGLE_KEY', 'Your API Key');
	include 'GoogleGeocode.class.php';

	$GEOCODE = new GoogleGeocode(GOOGLE_KEY);
	$params = array(
		'q' => 'Your address or whatever you want, as much info as possible',
		'region' => 'optional, default is US',
		'language' => 'optional, default is en',
		'oe' => 'optional, default is utf8',
		'sensor' => 'optional, default is false',
	);

	$info = $GEOCODE->search($params);

Or a simple search like:

	$info = $GEOCODE->search(array('q' => 'Your address here'));

Or even:

	$info = $GEOCODE->search('Your address here');

(Just for flexibility). When entering address, put as much info 
as you have, like a state or town, etc. It helps narrow it down quite a bit,
and it will be more accurate.

$info is an object which looks like:

stdClass Object
(
    [lat] => -122.4085364
    [lng] => 37.7893265
    [address] => Academy of Art College, San Francisco, CA 94108, USA
    [state] => CA
    [city] => San Francisco
    [zip] => 94108
)


Errors and Debugging
--------------------

If an error occurs with the loopup, the search() function returns false

	if($info === false)
	{
		echo 'ERROR: '.$GEOCODE->error() .' (code: '.$GEOCODE->errno().')';
	}

With the errno() and error() functions, the same as in MySQL
You can also get back the last URL (used in the last query with):

	$url = $GEOCODE->query_url();

In case you want to check out what's being sent by hand (paste it into a browser)

That's about it! :)
